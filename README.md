WebSocket Server (Learning Project)
---
This is a simple WebSocket server built using the ws library for learning how real-time communication works in Node.js.

The server accepts WebSocket connections, listens for messages from clients, and broadcasts events to other connected users. It is designed to demonstrate core concepts like connection lifecycle, message handling, and room-based communication without unnecessary complexity.

The goal is understanding WebSockets, not production readiness.
There is no authentication, persistence, or scaling logic.

Built with Node.js + TypeScript, this project is intentionally minimal and easy to reason about.
